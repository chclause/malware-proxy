This simple proxy was created as an assignment for CS4480 Computer Networks
at the University of Utah.  It intercepts GET requests from a client, makes
a request to the desired server, then checks the file or object for malware
using the VirusTotal API.  See: https://www.virustotal.com/ 
Finally, it returns the file or object to the client if it passes the scan.
