How To Use:
    This file uses python 2
    You must have the "requests" library installed to run this
    
    Navigate to the directory that has the python program in it on your terminal.
    Then type '$./malware_proxy.py <port #> <API Key>'. Type a valid port number, 
    0-65535 in place of <port #> in the above command.  
    Type a valid VirusTotal api key in place of <API Key>.
    For example,
    $./malware_proxy.py 1024 apikey1234


    IMPORTANT NOTES:  If you choose a port lower than 1024, you must have super user
                       privilages!  If you must choose a port lower than 1024, please
                       use the command '$sudo ./malware_proxy.py 80'

                      Requests from the client must be in absolute uri form,
                        this was in the assignment specifications.
                    
                      This proxy server DOES NOT detect malware after you have reached
                        Virus Totals rate limit.  It will let all requests through ,as
                        opposed to just blocking usage to the internet.
                        DO NOT exceed the rate limit when testing this proxy.  Code would
                        be put in place to handle this situation if this proxy was going
                        to be used in a real-world environment.  This proxy is for testing
                        the functionality only.
